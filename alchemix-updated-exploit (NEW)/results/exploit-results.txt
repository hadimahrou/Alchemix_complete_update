  DEMONSTRATING THE VULNERABILITY IN ALCHEMIX WSTETH ADAPTER
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  
VULNERABLE CODE PATTERN IN ALCHEMISTV2:
  1. Check if amount would be sufficient:
     if (adapter.unwrap(shares, 0) < minimumAmountOut) {
         revert SlippageError();
     }
  2. Perform actual unwrap:
     amount = adapter.unwrap(shares, 0);  // Note: 0 as minAmountOut!
  
WHY THIS IS VULNERABLE:
  1. The check and execution are separate operations
  2. Both operations use 0 as the minAmountOut parameter
  3. An attacker can manipulate the price between operations
  4. This happens because the actual slippage parameter is never used in the adapter
  
ATTACK SCENARIO:
  - User sets 5% slippage protection (minimumAmountOut = 95% of expected)
  - Attacker front-runs and manipulates price down
  - Initial check still passes because price is only slightly manipulated
  - Between check and execution, attacker further manipulates price
  - Execution proceeds with zero slippage protection
  - User receives less than their minimum expected amount
  - Attacker back-runs to restore price and take profit
  
CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION:
  1. Either pass minimumAmountOut to adapter.unwrap():
     amount = adapter.unwrap(shares, minimumAmountOut);
  2. Or combine check and execution in one atomic operation
  
ADDRESSING IMMUNEFI'S RESPONSE:
  - Yes, AlchemistV2 performs a slippage check
  - But it still calls adapter.unwrap with 0 as minAmountOut
  - This creates a window of vulnerability between check and execution
  - Our PoC proves this vulnerability exists despite upstream checks
  
CONCLUSION: This is a real vulnerability that needs to be fixed

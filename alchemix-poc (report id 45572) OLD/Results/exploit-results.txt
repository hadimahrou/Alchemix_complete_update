  =================== VULNERABILITY IMPACT SUMMARY ===================
  Normal expected ETH from withdrawal: 30 ETH
  Actual ETH received after attack: 20 ETH
  Victim's loss: 10 ETH
  Attacker's estimated profit: 8 ETH
  
  Percentage of expected funds lost: 33 %
  
  =================== VULNERABILITY EXPLANATION ===================
  The vulnerability stems from hardcoded zero slippage protection in the
  WstETH adapter's unwrap function. This allows attackers to manipulate
  the liquidity pool price just before large withdrawals or liquidations,
  resulting in victims receiving significantly less ETH than expected.
  
  The fix requires modifying the adapter to properly handle slippage
  parameters passed down from the Alchemist contract.
